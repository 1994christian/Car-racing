How to download automotive materials
====================================

Epic Games' [Automotive Materials][automatlink] package can be downloaded for
free from the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

NOTE: Unfortunately, Unreal's Marketplace is only available on Windows, so you
need a Windows machine to download this package.

  2. Buy the [Automotive Materials][automatlink] package for $0.
  3. Create a new dummy project and add the Automotive Materials package to it.
  4. Inside the "Content" folder of the newly created project, you can find the "AutomotiveMaterials" folder. Copy this folder to the CARLA project
    - `{NewProject}/Content/AutomotiveMaterials` --> `{CARLA}/Unreal/CarlaUE4/Content/AutomotiveMaterials`
